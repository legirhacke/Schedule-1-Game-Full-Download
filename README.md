# Game Overview

Step into the shoes of a novice drug dealer as you arrive in a new town, starting completely broke, without any product or connections. Forge your drug empire from scratch in the gritty west-coast city of Hyland Point. Navigate the challenges posed by relentless law enforcement and rival cartels as you work to dominate the underworld.

* Create a diverse array of drugs, each with its own unique production method. Uncover special recipes to craft innovative drug variants with distinct attributes.
* Traverse Hyland Point by walking, skating, or driving to ensure your products reach your customers. Recruit dealers to manage distribution on your behalf.
* Invest in new properties and hire staff to enhance your operations. Collaborate with suppliers to establish a fully automated production and distribution network.
* This line of work is fraught with dangerâ€”brave escalating law enforcement efforts and confront lethal competitors. Equip yourself for combat with fists, melee weapons, or firearms.
* As your empire grows, effective management becomes essential. Experience new heights in cooperative multiplayer gameplay.
